A point in space where all mana converges. Magic is neither good noor evil but is capable of both when the raw chaos it is made from is shaped in the hands of such beings. Only a creature attuned to true balance could wield the raw power of the nexus as is. While this wand indeed seems to manipulate the essence of raw chaos its name was probably a wimsy of the deity who made it. Theres no way you could legitimately be plaing with the origin point of magic itself right?",
