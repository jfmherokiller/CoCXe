Her lower body is much the same, feather-covered hips and thighs merging with scales around the knee and ending in a clawed lizard foot; not to mention the long, fiery tail that swishes to and from behind her as she circles you. \n\nStanding perhaps six and a half feet tall, her large breasts strain against the tarnished metal of her vest, just as her ample hips threaten to burst free from her tight loincloth. A half-erect lizard cock pokes out pushing the cloth to one side and allowing for a clear view of her slick, puffy pussy just below it.
