As your eyes adjust to the light, it resolves into an upside-down blue-eyed, blue-skinned face wreathed with snubby, shoulder-length tentacles of purple and green hue.  The silence continues as you stare into it, until you move to push yourself off the hard ground.  At the first sign of activity, the head disappears into the water barrel with a sloshing sound.

The theme of gawky angularity suggested by her bust holds force throughout; though she's about as tall as her race gets, her pair of small tits - they can't be bigger than an A-cup - is nearly concealed by drooping gills almost comically oversized for her chest.  Her torso is slender, while her hips are somewhat more curvy by contrast, sloping out gently below the waist to descend into narrow, long legs and form a general feminine structure, albeit one from underfunded builders.  A blue wiener hangs from her pelvis, dangling in the open space between her thighs.  This girl is skinny, no matter how you look at her.");

Politely and carefully handing it back to you, she resumes her seat and the water level rises slightly to cover her legs.  You stare at the dipper and then at her; she returns your gaze unflinchingly, splashing some liquid on her exposed gills with an idle hand.");

Won't it be absurdly toilsome to evict someone from your water barrel without speaking a word of their language or using physical force?  Your mind, unwilling to fathom answers to these questions - which is just as well since they're all variations on 'yes' - latches onto the trivial like a lifeline.  The water level was definitely lower than you left it before your nap.  Maybe she absorbed it through her skin as she grew to adulthood?  This might explain why her hips and thighs are better developed than her chest and 'hair'.");
